# React Zustand and React Query Practice

Just practicing with **Zustand**, **React Query**, and **caching** in React.

## What I'm Learning & Testing
- Using **Zustand** for state management.
- Fetching data with **React Query**.
- Working with **caching** and how it interacts with state.

## Clone to playaround 

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mamun7115/cache_state_localapi.git
